## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[Your Org]/[Your Repo]/issues). Before reporting a bug, please perform the following steps:

1.  **Check the [Project Documentation]**: Read the relevant documentation ([README.md](./README.md), [Architecture](./architecture.md), platform-specific READMEs) to ensure the behavior isn't intended or already documented.
2.  **Search Existing Issues**: Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/[Your Org]/[Your Repo]/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
3.  **Isolate the Problem**: Try to create a minimal reproducible example if possible.

When you are ready to report a bug:

*   **Use a clear and descriptive title**.
*   **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
*   **Explain the behavior you observed** after following the steps.
*   **Explain the behavior you expected to see** and why.
*   **Include details about your environment**:
    *   Which part of the project is affected (e.g., `backend-python`, `frontend-react`, `mobile-android`)?
    *   Operating System & Version.
    *   Browser & Version (if applicable).
    *   Node.js/Go/Python/Dart/Swift version (as relevant).
    *   Any other relevant context.
*   **Include screenshots or logs** if helpful.

<!-- Consider creating GitHub Issue Templates for bug reports -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/[Your Org]/[Your Repo]/issues) or potentially [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/[Your Org]/[Your Repo]/discussions) if enabled.

1.  **Search Existing Issues/Discussions**: Ensure the enhancement hasn't already been suggested.
2.  **Provide Context**: Explain the problem or use case the enhancement would address. Why is this feature needed?
3.  **Detail Your Suggestion**: Clearly describe the enhancement. Mockups, examples, or specific details are helpful.
4.  **Explain Potential Benefits**: Why would this be useful to users or developers?
5.  **(Optional) Suggest Implementation**: If you have ideas on how to implement it, feel free to share them.

<!-- Consider creating GitHub Issue Templates for feature requests -->

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these labels on the issues:

*(Adjust labels based on your project's usage)*

### Pull Requests

Code contributions are primarily made via Pull Requests (PRs).

1.  **Ensure Relevance**: Make sure your contribution aligns with the project's goals and scope. It's often best to discuss significant changes in an issue first.
2.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository on GitHub.
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from the `main` (or `develop`) branch in your fork. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix/login-button-bug`, `feature/add-profile-picture-upload`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```
4.  **Make Changes**: Implement your fix or feature.
5.  **Follow Styleguides**: Ensure your code adheres to the project's style guides (see [Styleguides](#styleguides)).
6.  **Include Tests**: Add relevant unit, integration, or end-to-end tests for your changes. Ensure all tests pass.
7.  **Commit Changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages following the [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages) style.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat(profile): Add profile picture upload functionality"
    ```
8.  **Push Branch**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```
9.  **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request from your branch to the project's `main` (or `develop`) branch.
    *   **Use a clear title** describing the change.
    *   **Provide a detailed description** explaining the "what" and "why" of your changes.
    *   **Link to any relevant issues** (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    *   Include screenshots or GIFs if visual changes are involved.
10. **Address Feedback**: Be prepared to discuss your changes and address any feedback from maintainers during the code review process. Make changes to your branch and push them; the PR will update automatically.

## Development Setup

Instructions for setting up the development environment for each part of the project can be found in their respective README files:

*   Refer to the **[Root README](./README.md#getting-started)** for overall setup.
*   Check the `README.md` within each platform directory (`backend-go/`, `frontend-react/`, etc.) for specific installation and running instructions.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

This project aims to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This allows for automated changelog generation and helps communicate the nature of changes at a glance.

Examples:

*   `feat: Allow users to upload avatars`
*   `fix: Correct calculation for order total`
*   `docs: Update backend setup instructions`
*   `style: Format code according to Black/Prettier`
*   `refactor: Simplify user authentication logic`
*   `test: Add unit tests for profile service`
*   `chore: Update CI configuration`

### Code Style

Consistency is key. Please adhere to the established code style:

*   **General:** Follow idiomatic practices for the language/framework being used. Write clear, understandable code. Add comments where necessary but prefer self-documenting code.
*   **Linters/Formatters:** This project uses linters and formatters to enforce style. Please run them before committing:
    *   **Python:** `[e.g., Black, Flake8, isort]` (See `backend-python/README.md`)
    *   **Go:** `[e.g., go fmt, golangci-lint]` (See `backend-go/README.md`)
    *   **TypeScript/JavaScript:** `[e.g., ESLint, Prettier]` (See `frontend-react/README.md` or `mobile-crossplatform/README.md`)
    *   **Dart:** `[e.g., dart format, Dart analyzer/linter rules in analysis_options.yaml]` (See `mobile-crossplatform/README.md`)
    *   **Kotlin:** `[e.g., ktlint, Android Studio formatter]` (See `mobile-android/README.md`)
    *   **Swift:** `[e.g., SwiftLint, Xcode formatter]` (See `mobile-ios/README.md`)
*   Configuration files for these tools are included in the repository. Consider setting up your editor to use them automatically.
