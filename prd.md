## 3. Features & Requirements

This section details the specific functionalities. Use User Stories, Use Cases, or detailed feature descriptions. **Organize these by Feature (aligning with the Feature-Sliced code structure):**

*   **3.1. Feature: [Feature A Name - e.g., User Authentication]**
    *   **3.1.1. User Story/Requirement:** `As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that [receive some benefit].`
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `[List specific, testable criteria that must be met]`
        *   `(AC1: ...)`
        *   `(AC2: ...)`
    *   **3.1.2. User Story/Requirement:** `[Another requirement for Feature A]`
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `[...]`
    *   *(Add more requirements for Feature A as needed)*

*   **3.2. Feature: [Feature B Name - e.g., Expense Tracking]**
    *   **3.2.1. User Story/Requirement:** `[...]`
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** `[...]`
    *   **3.2.2. User Story/Requirement:** `[...]`

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Describe requirements that define system attributes rather than specific functions.

*   **4.1. Performance:** Specify performance expectations (e.g., response times, load capacity).
    *   `[Example: API endpoints should respond within 500ms under normal load.]`
    *   `[Example: App should launch within 2 seconds on target devices.]`
*   **4.2. Scalability:** How should the system handle growth (users, data)?
    *   `[Example: The backend should support 10,000 concurrent users.]`
*   **4.3. Security:** Specify security measures, authentication, authorization, data privacy requirements.
    *   `[Example: All user passwords must be hashed using bcrypt.]`
    *   `[Example: API access requires JWT authentication.]`
*   **4.4. Reliability/Availability:** Uptime requirements, error handling expectations.
    *   `[Example: Service uptime should be 99.9%.]`
*   **4.5. Usability/Accessibility:** Adherence to usability principles or accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
    *   `[Example: App must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.]`
*   **4.6. Maintainability:** Code quality standards, documentation requirements (though architecture covers much of this).
*   **(Add other NFR categories as needed: Portability, Compliance, etc.)**

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   **5.1. Wireframes/Mockups:** Provide links to or embed key UI designs, wireframes, or prototypes.
    *   `[Link to Figma/Sketch/XD files]`
    *   `[Link to specific screens relevant to requirements]`
*   **5.2. Style Guide/Design System:** Link to any relevant style guides or design systems.
    *   `[Link to Design System documentation]`

## 6. Release Criteria & Success Metrics

*   **6.1. Release Criteria:** Define the conditions that must be met for the product/feature to be considered ready for release.
    *   `[Example: All P0 and P1 bugs fixed.]`
    *   `[Example: All acceptance criteria for defined features are met.]`
    *   `[Example: Performance tests pass under expected load.]`
*   **6.2. Success Metrics:** How will the success of this product/feature be measured post-launch? (Refer back to Goals).
    *   `[Metric 1: Daily Active Users (DAU) target: X]`
    *   `[Metric 2: Average session duration target: Y]`
    *   `[Metric 3: Feature adoption rate (e.g., % of users using charts) target: Z%]`
