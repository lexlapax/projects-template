## 1. Overview

This directory contains the source code for the backend service written in Python using `[Specify primary framework, e.g., FastAPI, Django, Flask]`. Its main responsibilities include:

*   `[Responsibility 1, e.g., Providing a RESTful API for frontend and mobile clients]`
*   `[Responsibility 2, e.g., Handling core business logic for feature X and Y]`
*   `[Responsibility 3, e.g., Interacting with the PostgreSQL database]`
*   `[Responsibility 4, e.g., Processing background tasks via Celery/RQ]`

---

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version `[Specify version, e.g., 3.10+]` (Check with `python --version`)
*   **Package Manager:** `[Specify pip with venv OR Poetry OR Conda, e.g., pip & venv]`
*   **Database (Local Development):** `[Specify DB needed, e.g., PostgreSQL 14+, Docker recommended]`
*   **Other Services (Local Development):** `[Specify others, e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker recommended]`
*   **(Optional) Docker & Docker Compose:** Recommended for easily managing dependencies like databases and message queues.

### 2.2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the main repository** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-project-name]/backend-python
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    *   **Using `venv` (Recommended):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    *   **Using `Poetry`:**
        ```bash
        poetry install
        poetry shell
        ```
    *   **Using `Conda`:**
        ```bash
        conda create --name [your-env-name] python=[your-version]
        conda activate [your-env-name]
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   **Using `pip`:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt # Or requirements-dev.txt
        ```
    *   **Using `Poetry`:** (Handled by `poetry install` above)
    *   **Using `Conda` with `pip`:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Modify the `.env` file with your local development settings (database connection strings, API keys, secret keys, etc.). Refer to `[Link to config loading logic, e.g., my_service/platform/config.py]` for required variables.

5.  **Database Setup (if applicable):**
    *   Ensure your local database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL running via Docker) is up.
    *   Run database migrations:
        ```bash
        # Example using Alembic
        alembic upgrade head

        # Example using Django
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

### 2.3. Running the Development Server

*   **Using Uvicorn (for FastAPI/Starlette):**
    ```bash
    uvicorn my_service.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    # Adjust 'my_service.main:app' to your application instance path
    ```
*   **Using Flask Development Server:**
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=my_service.main:app # Or your app entry point
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
    ```
*   **Using Django Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

The service should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:[PORT]`. Check the specific startup logs for the exact address.

## 3. Project Structure

A detailed explanation of the directory structure and architectural layers for this Python backend can be found in [./project-structure.md](./project-structure.md).

Key directories:

*   `my_service/`: Main application source code.
    *   `features/`: Contains code organized by business feature.
    *   `core/` | `platform/` | `shared/`: Shared code (domain, data access, UI utilities).
    *   `main.py`: Application entry point and setup.
*   `tests/`: Automated tests.
*   `migrations/`: Database migration scripts (e.g., Alembic, Django migrations).
*   `scripts/`: Utility scripts.

---

## 4. Running Tests

Ensure you have installed development dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt` or via `poetry install --with dev`).

*   **Run all tests (using pytest):**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
*   **Run tests with coverage:**
    ```bash
    pytest --cov=my_service --cov-report=term-missing
    ```
*   **Run specific test file:**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/features/feature_a/test_service.py
    ```

---

## 5. API Documentation

*   **API Specification:** Defined using `[e.g., OpenAPI (Swagger)]` and typically available automatically when the development server is running.
    *   Swagger UI: `http://localhost:[PORT]/docs` *(Adjust URL as needed)*
    *   ReDoc: `http://localhost:[PORT]/redoc` *(Adjust URL as needed)*
*   **Specification File:** `[Link to OpenAPI JSON/YAML file if generated/maintained separately, e.g., ../api/openapi.yaml]`
*   Refer to the main **[Architecture Document](../architecture.md#section-7-api-design)** for overall API design principles.

---

## 6. Database Migrations (if applicable)

This project uses `[e.g., Alembic / Django Migrations]` for managing database schema changes.

*   **Generate a new migration:**
    ```bash
    # Alembic
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

    # Django
    python manage.py makemigrations [app_name]
    ```
*   **Apply migrations:**
    ```bash
    # Alembic
    alembic upgrade head

    # Django
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
*   **Downgrade migrations:**
    ```bash
    # Alembic
    alembic downgrade -1 # Downgrade one revision

    # Django (more complex, often involves reverting code and migrating to a specific previous state)
    python manage.py migrate [app_name] [migration_name_before_target]
    ```

*   Specific notes for deploying this Python service:
    *   `[Detail specifics, e.g., Build Docker image using ./Dockerfile]`
    *   `[e.g., Use Gunicorn/Uvicorn worker setup for production]`
    *   `[e.g., Ensure environment variables are set correctly in the deployment environment]`
    *   `[e.g., Run database migrations as part of the deployment process]`
