**This is a template README. Please update it for your specific project!**

---

## Overview

This repository serves as a starting template for building `[briefly describe the type of project, e.g., a full-stack application, a mobile app with backend services]`. It provides a structured foundation based on **Feature-Based Slicing** and **Layered Architecture (Onion/Clean)** principles, aiming to promote:

*   **Maintainability:** Easier to understand, modify, and fix bugs.
*   **Scalability:** Supports growing complexity and team size.
*   **Testability:** Facilitates unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows easier adaptation to new requirements or technologies.

---

## Core Concepts & Structure

The architectural philosophy guiding this template is detailed in:

*   **[Project Structure Philosophy](./project-structure.md)**

This template organizes code by platform first, with detailed structure guides within each platform's directory:

*   `backend-go/`: Go backend service structure.
*   `backend-python/`: Python backend service structure.
*   `frontend-react/`: React web frontend structure.
*   `mobile-android/`: Native Android application structure.
*   `mobile-ios/`: Native iOS application structure.
*   `mobile-crossplatform/`: Cross-platform (Flutter/React Native) mobile app structure.

---

## How to Use This Template

1.  **Clone/Copy:** Clone this repository or copy its contents to start your new project.
2.  **Select Platforms:** Keep the platform directory(ies) relevant to your project (e.g., `backend-go` and `frontend-react`). Delete the others.
3.  **Define Requirements:** Fill out the **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./prd.md)** template with your project's specific goals and features.
4.  **Design Architecture:** Detail your technical choices and design in the **[Architecture Document](./architecture.md)** template, referencing the PRD and structure philosophy.
5.  **Plan Implementation:** Break down the work into phases and outline the execution plan in the **[Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md)** template.
6.  **Customize README:** **Replace the contents of this README.md** file with information specific to *your* project (see sections below).
7.  **Develop:** Start building your features within the chosen platform structure(s), following the layered principles and implementation plan.
