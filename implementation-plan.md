*   **1.2. Related Documents:**
    *   **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** [Link to prd.md](./prd.md)
    *   **Architecture Document:** [Link to architecture.md](./architecture.md)
    *   **Project Structure Philosophy:** [Link to project-structure.md](./project-structure.md)

## 2. Overall Scope & Assumptions

*   **2.1. Overall Scope:** Briefly summarize the total scope defined in the PRD (Section 1.3).
    *   `[Reiterate high-level goal and key features included in the entire project.]`
*   **2.2. Key Assumptions:** List any critical assumptions underpinning this plan.
    *   `[Example: Assumes availability of 2 backend engineers and 1 frontend engineer for Q3.]`
    *   `[Example: Assumes the chosen Cloud Provider services meet performance requirements.]`
    *   `[Example: Assumes designs from Figma link in PRD are finalized for Phase 1.]`

## 3. Phasing Strategy

*   **3.1. Approach:** Describe the strategy used to break the project into phases.
    *   `[Example: The project will be implemented in phases, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on core user authentication and expense tracking. Subsequent phases will add reporting and budgeting features.]`
    *   `[Example: Phasing is based on delivering end-to-end user journeys, starting with user onboarding.]`
*   **3.2. Phase Overview:** Briefly list the planned phases and their primary themes.
    *   `[Phase 1: Core Foundation & Authentication]`
    *   `[Phase 2: Expense Management CRUD]`
    *   `[Phase 3: Reporting & Visualization]`
    *   `[Phase 4: Budgeting & Advanced Features]`

## 4. Phase Breakdown

*(Repeat this section for each planned phase)*

### 4.X Phase [Phase Number]: [Phase Name/Theme, e.g., Phase 1: Core Foundation & Authentication]

*   **4.X.1. Phase Goal:** What is the primary, measurable objective of completing this phase?
    *   `[Example: Establish foundational infrastructure, allow users to sign up, log in, and log out securely via the mobile app.]`
*   **4.X.2. Scope (Features/Requirements):** List specific features/requirements from the PRD included in *this phase*. Reference PRD section numbers.
    *   `[PRD 3.1: User Authentication (All Requirements)]`
    *   `[PRD 4.3: Security Requirements related to Authentication (Password Hashing, JWT)]`
    *   `[PRD Section X.Y: Specific Requirement...]`
*   **4.X.3. Architecture Focus:** Which architectural components/areas (from `architecture.md`) are primarily built or significantly extended in this phase? Reference Architecture Document section numbers.
    *   `[Architecture 3.1: Backend - Go/Python Setup, Auth Framework]`
    *   `[Architecture 3.x: Mobile App - Basic Navigation, Auth UI Screens]`
    *   `[Architecture 5.1: Backend - Authentication Feature Module Implementation]`
    *   `[Architecture 5.4: Core Libraries - Domain models for User, Auth interfaces]`
    *   `[Architecture 7: API Design - Auth endpoints definition]`
    *   `[Architecture 8: Infrastructure - Initial CI/CD setup, Basic Cloud environment setup]`
*   **4.X.4. Key Tasks/Deliverables:** High-level breakdown of work items for this phase. These should ideally be broken down further in an issue tracker (Jira, GitHub Issues).
    *   `[Task 1: Setup CI/CD pipeline for Backend]`
    *   `[Task 2: Implement Backend User model and Auth repository interface (Core Domain)]`
    *   `[Task 3: Implement Backend Authentication Service/Use Cases]`
    *   `[Task 4: Implement Backend Auth API endpoints (REST/GraphQL)]`
    *   `[Task 5: Implement Backend JWT generation/validation]`
    *   `[Task 6: Implement Mobile App Auth State Management (Bloc/Store)]`
    *   `[Task 7: Build Mobile App Login/Signup UI Screens]`
    *   `[Task 8: Implement Mobile App API client for Auth endpoints]`
    *   `[Deliverable: Functional Login/Signup/Logout flow in the dev environment.]`
*   **4.X.5. Dependencies:** Note key dependencies for this phase to start or complete.
    *   `[Internal: Task 4 depends on Task 3.]`
    *   `[External: Requires finalized UI designs for Login/Signup screens (PRD 5.1).]`
    *   `[External: Requires Cloud environment access.]`
*   **4.X.6. Estimated Timeline (Optional):**
    *   `[Example: Sprints 1-4 (8 weeks)]`
    *   `[Example: Target Completion: End of Q3 2024]`
*   **4.X.7. Team/Responsibilities (Optional):**
    *   `[Backend Team: Tasks 1-5]`
    *   `[Mobile Team: Tasks 6-8]`
*   **4.X.8. Completion Criteria:** How will successful completion of this phase be verified? (Align with PRD Release Criteria for the included scope).
    *   `[Criteria 1: All User Stories/Requirements listed in 4.X.2 have met their Acceptance Criteria.]`
    *   `[Criteria 2: Automated tests (Unit, Integration) covering implemented logic pass.]`
    *   `[Criteria 3: Successful E2E test of Login/Signup/Logout flow.]`

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns Implementation

Describe how foundational elements are established and maintained across phases.

*   **5.1. CI/CD:** `[Example: Initial pipeline setup in Phase 1, incrementally enhanced with testing/deployment stages for new components in subsequent phases.]`
*   **5.2. Monitoring/Logging:** `[Example: Basic setup in Phase 1, metrics/logs added for new features as they are built.]`
*   **5.3. Security:** `[Example: Foundational auth in Phase 1, ongoing security reviews and implementation of specific NFRs per phase.]`
*   **5.4. Testing Strategy:** `[Example: Unit/Integration test coverage maintained >80% for all new code in each phase. E2E tests added for major flows per phase.]`
*   **5.5. Documentation:** `[Example: Architecture/PRD updated iteratively. Code documentation maintained throughout.]`

## 6. Resource Plan (Optional)

High-level overview of team allocation or required resources per phase if relevant.

*   **Phase 1:** `[e.g., 1 Tech Lead, 2 Backend Devs, 1 Mobile Dev, 0.5 QA]`
*   **Phase 2:** `[e.g., 1 Tech Lead, 2 Backend Devs, 2 Mobile Devs, 1 QA]`
