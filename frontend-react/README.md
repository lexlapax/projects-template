# Frontend Application: [Your Project Name] - React Component

**This README provides details specific to the React frontend application.**

For overall project goals, architecture, and structure philosophy, please refer to the main project documentation:

*   **Root README:** [../README.md](../README.md)
*   **Architecture Document:** [../architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## 1. Overview

This directory contains the source code for the frontend web application built with React (`[Specify version, e.g., v18]`) and TypeScript (`[Specify version, e.g., v4.8]`). Its main responsibilities include:

*   `[Responsibility 1, e.g., Providing the user interface for web users]`
*   `[Responsibility 2, e.g., Consuming the backend API to display and manage data]`
*   `[Responsibility 3, e.g., Handling user interactions and client-side state management]`
*   `[Responsibility 4, e.g., Implementing features X, Y, and Z]`

---

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version `[Specify version range, e.g., ^16 || ^18]` (Check with `node -v`)
*   **Package Manager:** `[Specify npm OR yarn, e.g., npm v8+ OR yarn v1.x]` (Check with `npm -v` or `yarn -v`)
*   **Browser:** A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 2.2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the main repository** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-project-name]/frontend-react
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   **Using `npm`:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Using `yarn`:**
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   This project uses environment variables prefixed with `[e.g., REACT_APP_ or VITE_]` for configuration (like API base URLs).
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Modify the `.env.local` file with your local development settings (e.g., `[VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api]`). Refer to `[Link to config loading logic or documentation]` for available variables.

### 2.3. Running the Development Server

*   **Using `npm`:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or npm start, depending on your setup (Vite uses 'dev', CRA uses 'start')
    ```
*   **Using `yarn`:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev # Or yarn start
    ```

This command starts the development server (usually with hot-reloading) and opens the application in your default browser. The local address is typically `http://localhost:[PORT]` (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for Vite, `http://localhost:3000` for CRA). Check the terminal output for the exact address.

## 3. Project Structure

A detailed explanation of the directory structure and architectural layers for this React application can be found in [./project-structure.md](./project-structure.md).

Key directories:

*   `src/`: Main application source code.
    *   `features/`: Contains code organized by business feature (UI, state, domain, infrastructure).
    *   `shared/`: Reusable code (components, hooks, domain types, API clients).
    *   `lib/`: Generic utility functions.
    *   `config/`: Application configuration access.
    *   `routing/`: Application routing setup.
    *   `styles/`: Global styles.
    *   `App.tsx`: Root application component.
    *   `main.tsx`: Application entry point.
*   `public/`: Static assets (index.html, images, fonts).
*   `tests/` | `src/**/__tests__/`: Automated tests (location may vary).

---

## 4. Running Tests

This project uses `[Specify test runner, e.g., Jest]` with `[Specify testing library, e.g., React Testing Library]` for automated testing.

*   **Run all tests:**
    *   **Using `npm`:**
        ```bash
        npm test
        ```
    *   **Using `yarn`:**
        ```bash
        yarn test
        ```
*   **Run tests in watch mode:**
    ```bash
    npm test -- --watch # (or similar flag depending on test runner)
    yarn test --watch
    ```
*   **Run tests with coverage:**
    ```bash
    npm test -- --coverage
    yarn test --coverage
    ```

---

## 5. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

*   **Using `npm`:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
*   **Using `yarn`:**
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

This command generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `[Specify build output directory, e.g., build/ or dist/]` directory. These files are ready for deployment to a static file server or CDN.

---

## 6. Linting and Formatting

This project uses `[Specify linter, e.g., ESLint]` and `[Specify formatter, e.g., Prettier]` to maintain code quality and consistency.

*   **Run linter:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint # or yarn lint
    ```
*   **Run formatter:**
    ```bash
    npm run format # or yarn format
    ```
*   Consider configuring your IDE to automatically lint and format code on save.

---

## 7. Deployment

*   Refer to the main **[Architecture Document](../architecture.md#section-8-infrastructure--deployment)** for the overall deployment strategy.
*   This frontend application consists of static assets generated by the `build` command.
*   Deployment typically involves:
    *   Running the `build` script in a CI/CD environment.
    *   Uploading the contents of the `[build/dist]` directory to a static hosting provider (`[e.g., AWS S3 + CloudFront, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages]`).
    *   Ensuring correct environment variables are available *at build time* if they influence the production bundle.

## 8. Contributing

Refer to the main project's contributing guidelines `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root directory. Specific conventions for React/TypeScript development (e.g., component patterns, hook usage, ESLint/Prettier rules) should be followed.
