## 1. Overview

This directory contains the source code for the backend service written in Go (`[Specify version, e.g., v1.19+]`). It uses `[Specify primary web framework/toolkit, e.g., Gin, Echo, Chi, net/http]` for handling requests. Its main responsibilities include:

*   `[Responsibility 1, e.g., Providing a RESTful/gRPC API for frontend and mobile clients]`
*   `[Responsibility 2, e.g., Handling core business logic for feature X and Y]`
*   `[Responsibility 3, e.g., Interacting with the PostgreSQL database via pgx/GORM]`
*   `[Responsibility 4, e.g., Publishing messages to Kafka/RabbitMQ]`

---

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

*   **Go:** Version `[Specify version, e.g., 1.19+]` (Check with `go version`)
*   **Database (Local Development):** `[Specify DB needed, e.g., PostgreSQL 14+, Docker recommended]`
*   **Other Services (Local Development):** `[Specify others, e.g., Redis, Kafka, Docker recommended]`
*   **(Optional) Docker & Docker Compose:** Recommended for easily managing dependencies like databases and message queues.
*   **(Optional) Task Runner:** `[Specify if used, e.g., Make]`

### 2.2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the main repository** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-project-name]/backend-go
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Go modules will typically download dependencies automatically on build or run, but you can fetch them explicitly:
    ```bash
    go mod download
    # or to ensure all dependencies are clean
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables / Configuration:**
    *   This project loads configuration from `[Specify source, e.g., environment variables, ./configs/config.dev.yaml]`.
    *   If using `.env` files (less common in Go but possible with libraries like `godotenv`):
        ```bash
        cp configs/.env.example configs/.env # Adjust paths if needed
        # Modify configs/.env with local settings
        ```
    *   If using config files (e.g., YAML):
        ```bash
        cp configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.dev.yaml # Adjust paths
        # Modify configs/config.dev.yaml with local settings
        ```
    *   Refer to `[Link to config loading logic, e.g., internal/platform/config/config.go]` for required variables/settings.

4.  **Database Setup (if applicable):**
    *   Ensure your local database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL running via Docker) is up and accessible according to your configuration.
    *   Run database migrations:
        ```bash
        # Example using golang-migrate (Check Makefile if available)
        migrate -database "${DB_URL}" -path ./migrations/postgres up

        # Example using ORM specific command if available
        # go run main.go db migrate
        ```
        *(Adjust command based on the migration tool used)*

### 2.3. Running the Development Server

*   **Using `go run`:**
    ```bash
    go run cmd/server/main.go
    ```
*   **Using `make` (if a Makefile exists):**
    ```bash
    make run # Or make dev, check Makefile targets
    ```
*   **Using a live-reload tool (like `air` or `realize`):**
    ```bash
    # Example using air (if configured via .air.toml)
    air
    ```

The service should now be running locally. Check the application logs for the port number (typically defined in config, e.g., `8080`).

## 4. Project Structure

A detailed explanation of the directory structure and architectural layers for this Go backend can be found in [./project-structure.md](./project-structure.md).

Key directories:

*   `cmd/server/`: Main application entry point (`main.go`), wiring, server start.
*   `internal/`: Contains the core application code, not intended for import by other projects.
    *   `features/`: Code organized by business feature (domain, service, handlers, storage adapters).
    *   `platform/` | `shared/`: Shared infrastructure code (database connections, config loading, server setup).
    *   `domain/`: Shared core domain models/errors (use sparingly).
*   `api/`: API definitions (e.g., OpenAPI specs, Protobuf files).
*   `configs/`: Configuration files.
*   `migrations/`: Database migration scripts.
*   `scripts/`: Utility scripts.

---

## 5. Running Tests

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    # Or use make if available: make test
    ```
*   **Run tests with coverage:**
    ```bash
    go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
    # Or use make if available: make test-coverage
    ```
*   **Run tests for a specific package:**
    ```bash
    go test ./internal/featureA/service/...
    ```
*   **Run tests verbosely:**
    ```bash
    go test -v ./...
    ```

---

## 6. API Documentation

*   **API Specification:** Defined using `[e.g., OpenAPI (Swagger) / Protobuf]`
    *   OpenAPI Spec Location: `[e.g., api/openapi/spec.yaml]`
    *   Protobuf Definitions: `[e.g., api/proto/]`
*   **Swagger UI:** If integrated (e.g., via `swaggo` or framework plugins), it might be available at `http://localhost:[PORT]/swagger/index.html`. *(Adjust URL)*.
*   Refer to the main **[Architecture Document](../architecture.md#section-7-api-design)** for overall API design principles.

---

## 7. Database Migrations (if applicable)

This project uses `[e.g., golang-migrate / GORM AutoMigrate / custom scripts]` for managing database schema changes.

*   **Using `golang-migrate`:**
    *   Apply all up migrations:
        ```bash
        migrate -database "${DB_URL}" -path ./migrations/[db_type] up
        ```
    *   Roll back the last migration:
        ```bash
        migrate -database "${DB_URL}" -path ./migrations/[db_type] down 1
        ```
    *   Create a new migration file:
        ```bash
        migrate create -ext sql -dir ./migrations/[db_type] -seq [description_of_change]
        ```
        *(Replace `${DB_URL}` with your connection string and `[db_type]` with e.g., `postgres`)*
*   *(Add instructions for other tools like GORM AutoMigrate if used)*

---

## 8. Building for Production

*   **Compile the binary:**
    ```bash
    # Basic build
    go build -o ./bin/server cmd/server/main.go

    # Optimized/Static build for Docker (example)
    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -v -o ./bin/server -ldflags='-s -w' cmd/server/main.go
    # Or use make if available: make build
    ```
*   The compiled binary will be located at `[e.g., ./bin/server]`.

---

## 9. Deployment

*   Refer to the main **[Architecture Document](../architecture.md#section-8-infrastructure--deployment)** for the overall deployment strategy.
*   Specific notes for deploying this Go service:
    *   Deployment usually involves running the compiled binary (`./bin/server`) generated in the previous step.
    *   Often deployed within a minimal Docker container (e.g., based on `scratch` or `alpine`) containing only the binary and any required static assets/config files. See `./Dockerfile` if present.
    *   Ensure necessary configuration (environment variables or config files) is provided to the running container/process.
    *   Run database migrations as part of the deployment pipeline before starting the new service version.

---

## 10. Linting and Formatting

This project uses standard Go tools and potentially additional linters.

*   **Format code:**
    ```bash
    go fmt ./...
    ```
*   **Run linters (if configured, e.g., `golangci-lint`):**
    ```bash
    golangci-lint run ./...
    # Or use make if available: make lint
    ```
*   **Tidy modules:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
